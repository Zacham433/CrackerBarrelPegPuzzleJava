# CrackerBarrelPegPuzzleJava
Java program to solve the Cracker Barrel Peg Puzzle found at https://shop.crackerbarrel.com/toys-games/games/travel-games/peg-game/606154

The program is currently working and solves the question. I would like to make some changes in the future, but I have a lot of homework to work on so it will have to wait for another time.

compile :
  make
  
run :
  java PegPuzzle
